            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe Marq. of Ormond with <hi>13000</hi> Hor≈øe and Foot is ≈øate down before the City of Dublin, with a re≈øolution to storm, if not ≈øuddenly ≈øurrendred upon ≈øummons; but renowned Col. Jones hath taken a re≈øolution to fight it out to the last man, and hath already made a gallant attempt and inroad vpon his Outquartes with <hi>2000</hi> Hor≈øe and Foot; and after a ≈øharp conflict Col. <hi>Jones</hi> made an honourable retreat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the City with the lo≈øse of <hi>7</hi> or <hi>8,</hi> be≈øides ≈øome ≈øew wounded; but the Lord <hi>Inchiquins</hi> Brigade of hor≈øe being gallantly moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, took vpon them great re≈øolution, and embraced the pur≈øuit within a quarter of a mile of the Gates, where we had a ≈øecond engagement, which continued very dubious for the ≈øpace of half an hour, till at last a con≈øiderable party of the Sea-men came in to our a≈ø≈øi≈øtance, who by their lining of the hedges, did ≈øo gall the Enemy, that they were forced to retreat, leaving above <hi>30</hi> men dead vpon the place; in which fight we took Captain <hi>Smith,</hi> Cornet <hi>John≈øon,</hi> and about ten more pri≈øoners, with the lo≈øse of five men.</p>
            <p>Since which time, they have made another attempt vpon our Out-guards, and vpon the neer approoch of their forlorn hope con≈øi≈øting of about <hi>60</hi> hor≈øe, <hi>30</hi> of ours an≈øwered their charge, and ≈øhot Lieut.

            <p>They are incamped within a mile and a half of the City, where they expect the coming vp of the Earl of <hi>Clanrickard,</hi> Lord <hi>Taff,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Dillon,</hi> with their forces, for a ≈øudden con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction; and then to make a ≈øharp ≈øtorm.</p>
            <p>Their Tents are pitcht on this ≈øide <hi>Fingles,</hi> their hor≈øe and foot lye all in our ≈øight; Col. <hi>Jones</hi> is labouring hard to fortifie against them, hath given Orders for the pulling down all the Outhou≈øes that may advantage their de≈øign, and hath ≈øet forth Proclamation for all the Iri≈øh Papists, and other di≈øaffected

            </p>
            <p>We have lost the good Town of <hi>Kildare,</hi> but it co≈øt the enemy ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deer; for after three or four de≈øperate a≈ø≈øaults made by them on the breaches, made by their Canon, having lost many of their men they ≈øent for a parley, and ob≈øerving the undauted re≈øolution of Lies Col. <hi>Hute≈øon</hi> and Cap. <hi>Dixon,</hi> who commanded the men there, &amp; mo- of the men vnder them, although many of their men would not figh≈øt at all, &amp; are ≈øince gone to the enemy, that they gave our men quartet in two dayes to carry away what they had, where was great ≈øtore of corr and meal, Balle≈øoman is be≈øieged, and it must be lo≈øt becau≈øe we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come to relieve them.</p>
            <p>We hear that <hi>Owen Oneal</hi> with his forces is joyned with them of <hi>Kilkenny</hi> against us, but we have no certainty thereof.
